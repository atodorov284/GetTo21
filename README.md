# GetTo21
A game whose purpose is to be the first to get 21 matches. You can pick 1, 2 or 3 matches each round. There is an AI that will most probably beat you unless you know how to beat the game every time (there is a simple algorithm from game theory). It is static because minimax algorithm consumes too much resources (3^21).
Requirements: pygame
